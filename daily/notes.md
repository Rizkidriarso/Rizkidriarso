# Working notes

- Capture what changed or stood out today.

- Revisit older notes to see patterns.

- Keep writing clean and calm in tone.

- Let the content grow steadily over time.

- Write short notes that capture key observations.

- Highlight small wins or clear realizations.

- Avoid long writing; prefer clear bullet points.

- Track ideas that seem useful later on.

- Maintain consistency by updating a little daily.
